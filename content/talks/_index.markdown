#Talks

I have given talks to my research group and other peer groups about

- A notion of the box dimension for C-star algebras, from [this paper]("https:link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00220-002-0741-0").

- A generalization of curvature measures to graph-directed self-similar multifractal probability measures.
